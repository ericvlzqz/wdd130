        <p>Hi! My name is Eric Velazquez and I'm from Mexico City, Mexico. I am currently an employee of AT&T and I just
            started studying Web Design online. I hope to become a front-end web developer once I graduate. In my free
            time, I enjoy listening to music, skateboarding and drawing cartoons.</p>
